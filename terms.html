                <p><em>Last updated: July 21, 2017</em></p>

                <p>This document acts as an agreed upon Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service")
                between you (the "User" or "you") and TeaToken.io ("TeaToken"). You accept
                these Terms when you use TeaToken services or any other features, technologies or
                functionalities offered by TeaToken on TeaToken web-site at
                http://teatoken.io (the "Site") or through any other means (collectively,
                "Services"). The terms "us", "we", or "our" refer to TeaToken.</p>

                <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and
                compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who
                access or use the Service. We will provide notice of any amendment to these Terms by
                posting any revised terms to the site and updating the "Last updated" field above
                accordingly or by any other method we deem appropriate. We are not obligated to provide
                notice in any other method beyond these. Any change to these Terms will be effective
                immediately upon such notice and apply to any ongoing or subsequent use of the Site,
                Services, or Platform.</p>

                <p>TeaToken provides online features (the "Platform") to allow users to easily
                conduct the issuance and management of blockchain, distributed ledger technology
                ("DLT"), or otherwise cryptographically secured tokens ("Tokens") - whether or not they
                are sometimes colloquially referred to as "cryptocurrencies."</p>

                <p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
                disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</strong></p>

                <h2>Qualifications of User in Order to Use the Site</h2>

                <p>The User represents and warrants that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age,
                are legally entitled to use the internet and services like those provided by
                TeaToken (according to the laws and any relevant jurisdiction in which you
                reside), and have not had your right to use our service previously suspended or revoked
                by us.</p>

                <h2>Illegal and Prohibited Use</h2>

                <p>The User represents and warrants that you will not use the Site or Platform for any
                criminal, illegal, or otherwise prohibited use, including (but not limited to)
                activities related to money-laundering, drug trafficking, human trafficking, weapon
                trafficking, terrorism, securities fraud, or tax evasion. You represent and warrant
                that you will not use our platform to assist any other party in such illegal
                activity.</p>

                <p>The User represents and warrants that you will not in any way use the Platform or
                Services to: distribute spam, junk communications or chain letters; reverse engineer or
                otherwise improperly access any of the Site's or the Platforms underlying code or
                technical mechanisms; cause damage to the Site or TeaToken through any means,
                including (but not limited to) through the use of hacking, malware, viruses,
                illegitimate credentials, phishing, brute force attacks, SQL exploits, or any other
                method of detrimentally intercepting, interrupting, or damaging any information or
                functionality related to the Site. You also agree not to transfer access to your
                Account (as defined below) or any other rights granted to you by these Terms.</p>

                <!-- <h2>Registration and Account</h2>

                <p>The use of our Services requires you to create an account with TeaToken
                ("Account"). You warrant and represent that all information provided when creating such
                an Account is current, complete, and accurate. You agree to promptly notify TeaToken
                of any changes to any information that would cause the information provided upon your
                Account's creation to no longer be current, complete or accurate. You also warrant and
                represent that you understand that no Account will be fully created until you confirm
                your identity and email address in a manner deemed suitable by us.</p>

                <p>You agree that you exclusively will access and use your Account, and may not
                transfer the right of its use or disclose any log-in credentials to a third party
                without our written consent. You agree to take full responsibility for any activity
                that occurs through the use of your account, and cannot transfer this obligation to any
                third party. You agree to notify TeaToken in the event that you discover or suspect
                any security breaches or vulnerabilities related to the Site, Services or Platform.</p> -->

                <h2>Damages Caused by Vulnerabilities Inherent in the Internet or in Blockchain</h2>

                <p>Use of the internet is known to not be one-hundred percent secure. You agree that
                TeaToken is not responsible whatsoever for any damages caused by the interception,
                loss or alteration to any information sent over the internet. While TeaToken will
                take reasonable steps to ensure the security and privacy of any information transmitted
                during your use of our Services, in no event will any such information be considered
                "confidential" or will its disclosure to a third party, accidental or otherwise, cause
                liability against TeaToken, even if it occurs as a result of our negligence.</p>

                <p>TeaToken takes every reasonable precaution to prevent and mitigate attacks.
                However, these problems still may occur from time to time for reasons that are out of
                our control. If TeaToken believes a Token active on the Platform has been
                compromised or is under attack, TeaToken reserves the right to immediately stop all
                Services related to such Token. If it is determined that such an attack caused an
                associated Token to rapidly lose value or otherwise cause or threaten to cause damage
                to the Platform, the Site, or other users, TeaToken may immediately discontinue all
                activity regarding such Token entirely at its discretion. Resolution concerning
                deposits, withdrawals, Account balances, Services or other disputes related to an
                attacked Token will be determined on a case-by-case basis. TeaToken makes no
                representation and does not warrant the safety of the Platform and is not liable for
                any lost value or stolen property, regardless of whether TeaToken was negligent in
                providing appropriate security.</p>

                <h2>TeaToken Does Not Provide Legal, Financial or Investing Advice</h2>

                <p>In no way should our providing of Services be considered legal, financial, investing
                advice or any other kind of specialized or expert advice on which the User might
                detrimentally depend, causing liability against TeaToken. In using the Platform, you
                represent and warrant that you have sought any legal, financial, investment or
                otherwise specialized advice from an expert qualified to provide such counsel, or else
                you have the sufficient knowledge and sophistication to evaluate the risks and merits
                associated with Blockchain and/or Token management and offerings and to competently use
                our Services. We give no warranty regarding the suitability of any Tokens or other
                assets acquired using our Platform and assume no fiduciary duties to you.</p>

                <p>The User represents and warrants you understand that any recommendations or
                commentary made by TeaToken or its employees or other users should be considered
                generalized in nature, and you should use your own judgment or seek the advice of an
                expert before taking any action regardless of such statement. We give no assurance as
                to the accuracy or completeness of any such statement.</p>

                <h2>Purchase of Tokens</h2>

                <p>The User can transfer ETH to our Platform to
                purchase tokens listed on the Site. Your funds will appear in your Account depending on
                the processing time of the transaction, which is out of TeaToken's control. Tokens can only
                be purchased during the official token sale by accepting the respective Terms of Token Sale.
                </p>

                <h2>Distribution of Tokens</h2>

                <p>Tokens purchased by the User will be issued according to the respective Terms of
                Token Sale. Once issued by the seller of the tokens, TeaToken will distribute your tokens
                through your Ethereum wallet via smart contract. You shall be responsible for implementing reasonable measures
                for securing the wallet, vault or other storage mechanism your decide to use to receive
                and hold Tokens outside of your Account, including any requisite private key(s) or
                other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your private key(s)
                or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to the purchased tokens.
                TeaToken shall not be responsible for any such losses.</p>

                <h2>License</h2>

                <p>We grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable license ("License") to access
                and use our Platform, Site and Services. This License is subject to these Terms. Any
                other use of the Services not expressly permitted by these Terms is prohibited. All
                other rights in the Platform are reserved by TeaToken and our licensors, including

                incorporate into any other works or websites, or otherwise exploit any such content or
                functionality without prior express written consent of TeaToken.</p>

                <h2>Termination</h2>

                <p>We may terminate or suspend your License to our Services without prior notice or
                liability for any reason whatsoever, including (but not limited to) if you breach the
                Terms. Nothing in these terms or in any other communication or action by TeaToken or
                our employees, agents or representatives should be taken as a waiver of any legal
                remedies available for any event causing termination.</p>

                <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall
                survive termination, including (but not limited to) ownership provisions, disclaimers
                or limitations of obligations or liability, and indemnity.</p>

                <h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>

                <p>TeaToken or other users may provide links to third-party web sites or services
                that are not owned or controlled by TeaToken. TeaToken has no control over, and
                assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third
                party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that TeaToken shall
                not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
                alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or detrimental reliance on any
                information, content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or
                services. TeaToken is not liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of
                interacting with any third party content on our Site.</p>

                <h2>Copyright of Communications In Connection With Our Services</h2>

                <p>You agree that any materials, information or communications transmitted between the
                User and TeaToken in any form, or between the User and any other TeaToken user
                via our Platform, are non-confidential and will become the sole, exclusive property of
                TeaToken. TeaToken will own all intellectual property rights to such
                communications or materials, and can use or disseminate them in a completely
                unrestricted fashion for any legal purpose, commercial or otherwise, without notifying
                or compensating you. You hereby waive any right to litigation or recovery for perceived
                damages caused by the use of this information as is permissible by law.</p>

                <h2>Indemnification</h2>

                <p>You agree to indemnify, exculpate and hold TeaToken, its representatives,
                affiliates, employees and service providers harmless from any claim or demand
                permissible by law arising out of or related to the use of these Services, including
                any breach by you of these Terms or violation of any law, rule, or rights of a third
                party. You agree to pay for any legal fees or other costs that incurred TeaToken or
                any other indemnified parties as a result of your actions.</p>

                <h2>Disclaimer of Warrants and Guarantees</h2>

                <p>TeaToken does not guarantee any level of performance or the continued,
                uninterrupted availability of our Services. We do not guarantee the accuracy of any
                information provided on the Site. We hereby disclaim all warrants and guarantees that
                not expressly made in these Terms.</p>

                <h2>Applicable Law and Venue</h2>

                <p>The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of these Terms, and all
                acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties
                hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
                the United States, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.</p>

                <h2>Arbitration</h2>

                <p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or
                proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") in which either Party seeks to bring an
                individual action in small claims tribunals or seeks injunctive or other equitable
                relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without
                limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you
                and the Company (i) waive your and the Company's respective rights to have any and all
                Disputes arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive
                your and the Company's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company
                will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute
                to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and
                binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or
                jury in court).</p>

                <h2>No Class Arbitration, Class Action or Representative Actions</h2>

                <p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to you and the
                Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be
                brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative
                proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual
                attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of
                individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of
                representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any
                other individual or group of individuals. Any Dispute shall be referred to and finally
                resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
                ("SIAC") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International
                Arbitration Centre ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed
                to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be
                Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrator(s). The language of the
                arbitration shall be English.</p>

                <h2>Survival and Severability</h2>

                <p>Any portion of these Terms that reasonably should survive the termination of your
                License or any other agreement is hereby agreed to do so. If any provision of these
                terms is deemed illegal, invalid or otherwise invalid for any reason, then that
                provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms will remain intact and
                enforceable.</p>

                <h2>Integration</h2>

                <p>Our failure to exercise or enforce any rights or provisions of these Terms does not
                constitute a waiver of those rights or provisions. These Terms represent the entire and
                complete agreement between the User and TeaToken, including any future modification
                of these Terms, superseding any prior agreements or communications between you and us.
                Any ambiguities in these Terms shall be construed in the light most favorable to
                TeaToken.</p>

                <h2>Act of God</h2>

                <p>TeaToken' performance under these Terms shall be excused if the failure of such
                performance is caused by forces beyond its reasonable control. This includes (but is
                not limited to) acts of God, acts of any government, war or civil unrest, severe
                weather, fire, natural disasters, political embargos, terrorism, power or equipment
                failure, industrial or labor disputes or controversies, acts of any third party, or
                blockchain failures.</p>
